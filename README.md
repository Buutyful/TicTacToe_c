# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is always a fun and easy way to test out a new language 😄, 
and C is a really weird one! It makes simple things become hard 😅.

The console input is not the best. 
Just type a digit and press Enter for both the row and column!

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the row and column for your move.
